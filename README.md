This project requires JupyterLab to run. 

The main file is DSC630_LincolnBrown_JamesMulvihill_GroupProject.ipynb.

Also the port_phillip_bay_map.html file will show you a visual map of the houses for sale in Melbourne. As you zoom in, the map will give you a more granular breakdown of the number of houses for sale by area in the city.

This was a team project completed by Lincoln Brown and me (James Mulvihill).
